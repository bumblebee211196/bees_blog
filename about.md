I'm a **Backend Developer** at **Zoho Corporation**. I work on project closely related to **Machine Learning**, **Big
Data**, **Distributed Systems** and **Message Queues** and experienced in **Python**, **Java** and **Scala**. Being the
enthusiastic person I am, always looking for challenging problems/opportunities to solve and learn new things. This
curiosity of finding and solving challenging things attracts me towards competitive coding. Apart from this, I enjoy
gaming to a great extent during my leisure. I try to balance both these things but at times one overtake the other. I
am quite adventurous and quite an explorer I must say, once happened to trek the [Triund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triund) summit (2800 M). Being a foodie,
I often work on sharpening my cooking skills.
